We did a good job finishing all the tasks.

We weren't able to complete some tasks

The task was underestimated and look much longer to finish

The task was overestimated so I had to look for things to do

The acceptance criteria was confusing

I had to spend most of time learning about platform

The team who were supposed to help me were so busy they couldn't help me

It turned out that this task was already completed by her

The task should have been split into two parts

The task should have been combined as one

I should have not taken that task

I got sick last week so I could not complete most of my tasks

We added many task in the middle of sprint

We cut many tasks in the middle of the sprint

We had many incomplete tasks during this sprint.
